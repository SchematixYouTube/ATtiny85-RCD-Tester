# ATtiny85-RCD-Tester
A tool used for diagnosing faulty/Testing RCCB / RCBO / RCD/ GFCI devices
Why did I build this? I bought a few RCBO's online and wanted to compare them to assess what units were good & bad. 
The issue is most RCD response testers are in the $$$ to $$$$ price range. I wanted something cheap to build while 
offering acceptable accuracy. On that subject, you can expect in a 100ms test duration a reading between 98~108. 
Or simply put, a 10% margin of error.

Build Video: COMING SOON!

Please be aware this circuit uses high voltage AC & DC power. 
Please exercise caution when the circuit is powered & take appropriate safety precautions. 
Don't be reckless with High voltage! It can lead to damage to property, injury or even a fatal shock. 
If you choose to build or replicate what you see in the video you are doing so at your own risk/responsibility!
